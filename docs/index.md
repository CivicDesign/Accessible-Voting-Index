# The Election Accessibility Index

!!! warning "The challenge: an election participation gap for people with disabilities"

According to the Elections Assistance Commission (EAC), in 2020, people with disabilities were 5.7% less likely to vote. 

This gap has been slowly closing, but we can do better. One problem is that there are 6000+ jurisdictions running elections under 50 state laws. This makes it a challenge to find nationwide information; local election administration means that accessible voting is a patchwork of systems and practices.

It’s even hard to know how to find the information in the first place, with accessible voting details hidden in variations in terminology and web navigation. In a preliminary analysis of election websites in all 50 states, the Center for Civic Design found:

* 21 variations on “voters with a disability”
* 16 variations on “accessible voting”
* 03 variations on  “assistance”
* 11 sites do not have a dedicated page for accessible voting 

!!! alert "The solution: the accessible voting index"

With a nationwide database of the options available for accessible voting, we can make it easy to share information, design solutions for real problems, identify policies that make a difference, and help elections offices invite everyone to vote.

## What goes into the accessible voting index?

We start by collecting key accessible voting information and metrics that we can use for:

* State profiles: a state-by-state summary of the voting policies, procedures, systems, and information access that affect voters with disabilities.
* Comparisons: tools quickly identify or compare features and metrics by state.
