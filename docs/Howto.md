# Here's what you can do to help.

We’re collecting basic information for how to find information about accessible voting on a state election website. We’re focused on the official state websites in the United States because they should be a reliable and accessible source of information. The details you help us collect will be added to other data sources for policies and ways to vote, so we can create a resource that can help voters and be incorporated into other election information sites.

## Collect basic website information
We are building a picture of how easy it is for voters with disabilities to find and use information about accessible voting on the official election websites in 50 states and DC.

You will collect details about the information available on the state elections website and dome some quick checks of the accessibility of the information. I know. That's pretty meta, but tells us something about how accessible the whole site is.

We've divided this into three separate activities, so each one is short. Anyone can do the first two; the advanced activity requires a small amount of technical knowledge. The information you will collect includes both structured descriptions of the information and your insights about the user experience.

* Basic accessibility review of the page for accessible voting.
* Findability review looking at the path to the information.
* Advanced accessibility review with a few more evals that needs some technical knowledge


To get started on these activities, pick a state to explore. Ideally, it will be a place where you have lived and voted, so you have some context. But, you can pick any state you like to help us cover all 50 states and DC.

## Share your accessible voting stories</h2>
Do you have a story to tell? We want to hear it. We invite you to tell your own story about accessible voting. It can be from a recent election. Or it can be a chance to share your experience in this Hack as you tried to find information on a state website. We’ll use these stories to illustrate the importance of accessible voting and the ways elections can be full of barriers --- or delightful to use.

## Show us your design chops
Feeling creative? We’re gathering a lot of information and also need to make it delightful and intuitive to use. It needs to be accessible (of course), while making it easy to find and understand the accessible voting options in each state.

The site will run as a native web page (not an app), needs to look compelling and modern, be easy to read, invite exploration, and (of course) be completely accessible. Some examples from the election world, for inspiration, include HealthyVoting.org, the MIT Elections Performance Index, the EAC state profileslike <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/EAVS_2018_Data_Brief_PA.pdf">this one</a></li>

* A home page to show the scope of the information and start digging into the details by state
* A state page that is structured a easy to explore
* Ideas and inspirations for information visualizations
* A way to compare accessible voting in a 2 to 4 states

Work in your own favorite tools, then share our design ideas can be shared as wireframes, storyboards, page images, or a quick prototype. Share our work design sketches and a brief summary of your concept.
