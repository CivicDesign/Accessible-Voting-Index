# Personal stories about accessible voting 

Do you have a story to tell? We want to hear it.

This task is an opportunity to tell your own story about accessible voting. It can be from a recent election. Or it can be a chance to share your experience in this Hack as you tried to find information on a state website.

We’ll use these stories to illustrate the importance of accessible voting and the ways elections can be full of barriers --- or delightful to use.

Take the space that you need to tell the story well, but here’s a few tips:

* Focus on one thing. Break epics up into individual stories.
* Be specific. What was the barrier or success? 
* What happened? Were you able to solve the problem? How did it affect your voting experience? 
* Explain the impact. What was your reaction? How did it affect you?
* Share your ideas. Is there a non-obvious solution? A small thing that would improve the situation? 

## How to take part

Write your story and share it in this quick form.

We will not publish any story without reviewing it with you first, so we will need your name and contact information. We also want to know a little bit more about you for context and to help us match stories to details in the form.  The form asks for as much of this information as you are comfortable providing.
