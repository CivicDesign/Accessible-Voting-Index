<h2>Review state information on accessible voting</h2>
<p>We’re collecting basic information for how to find information about accessible voting on a state election website. We’re focused on the official state websites in the United States because they should be a reliable and accessible source of information. The details you help us collect will be added to other data sources for policies and ways to vote, so we can create a resource that can help voters and be incorporated into other election information sites.</p>

<p>All three of the challenges in this group start by picking a state to explore. Ideally, it will be a place where you have lived and voted, so you have some context. But, you can pick any state you like to help us cover all 50 states and DC.</p>

<h3>1. Collect basic website information</h3>
<p>We are building a picture of how easy it is for voters with disabilities to find and use information about accessible voting on the official election websites in 50 states and DC.</p>

<p>You will collect details about the information available on the state elections website, the accessibility of the information, You'll identify the types of information and do some quick checks for the accessibility of the information. I know. That's pretty meta, but if just 1 page on an official state elections site is accessible, this should be the one. And it tells us something about how accessible the whole site is. The information you will collect includes both structured descriptions of the information and your insights about the user experience. </p>

<h3>3. Report on findability, or how hard (or easy) it is to find that information</h3>
<p>You will collect details on the click path from the home page, internal and global site search, and whether the best pages appear near the top of search results. And, you'll identify what keywords help you get right to the information voters with disabilities need. <a href="https://www.jotform.com/form/212714629843157">Test link to form 2</a></p>

<H3>2. Tackle some more accessibility challenges</h3>
<p>Want to go deeper into the accessibility evaluation. Here's an opportunity to show off your chops with more accessibility evaluation of the site forms, PDF files and more, using your favorite evaluation tools.</p>

<h2>Explore the accessible voting experience and design the AVI</h2>
<p>Maybe accessibility evaluation, information architecture and other website explorations aren't your cuppa. 

<h3>4. Your accessible voting stories</h3>
<p>Do you have a story to tell? We want to hear it. We invite you to tell your own story about accessible voting. It can be from a recent election. Or it can be a chance to share your experience in this Hack as you tried to find information on a state website. We’ll use these stories to illustrate the importance of accessible voting and the ways elections can be full of barriers --- or delightful to use.</p>

<h3>5. The Accessible Voting Index Design Challenge</h3>
<p>Feeling creative? We’re gathering a lot of information and also need to make it delightful and intuitive to use. It needs to be accessible (of course), while making it easy to find and understand the accessible voting options in each state. We’re looking for designs for how to present all this information:<p>
<ul>
<li>A home page to show the scope of the information and start digging into the details by state</li>
  <li>A page to display all the information for a state in a structured, easy to explore ways</li>
  <li>Ideas and inspirations for information visualizations</li>
  <li>Ideas for how to filter the information displayed</li>
  <li>A way to compare accessible voting in a 2 to 4 states</li>
<li>A way to filter the list of states by accessible features they have in common (like: all states with no-excuse mail-in voting and same day registration)</li>
</ul>
<p>The site will run as a native web page (not an app), needs to look compelling and modern, be easy to read, invite exploration, and (of course) be completely accessible.</p>

<p>Your design ideas can be shared as wireframes, storyboards, page images, IA or design structure diagrams, or interactive design prototypes.
Along with the design sketches, you’ll also write a brief summary of your concepts and how they can help support the goals of making information about accessible voting be usable, useful, and accessible.</p>

<p>You'll work in your favorite tools and share the concepts and a description of your design goals and what inspired you, and anything else to explain why your concept is a good solution.</p>
