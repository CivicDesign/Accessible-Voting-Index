# About the Accessible Voting Index

There is an election participation gap: people with disabilities are almost 6% less likely to vote. One reason is that with 6000+ election offices in 50 states, finding information about accessible voting is a challenge.

We want to change that. We're building a nationwide database of the options available for accessible voting that can make accessible voting information easy to find, use, and share.

We envision state profiles with a summary of the voting policies, procedures, systems, and information access that affect voters with disabilities. And, a way to compare features by states, so we can identify opportunities to design solutions for real problems, identify policies that make a difference, and help elections offices invite everyone to vote.

## Here's what you can do to help.
